npm install --save redux-batched-updates

// Use as higher-order store
import { batchedUpdates } from 'redux-batched-updates';
const store = batchedUpdates(createStore)(reducer, intialState);

// Or as middleware
import { batchedUpdatesMiddleware } from 'redux-batched-updates';
const m = composeMiddleware(thunk, promise, batchedUpdatesMiddleware);
const store = applyMiddleware(m)(createStore)(reducer, initialState)
```
